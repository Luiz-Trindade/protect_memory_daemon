# RAM Memory Protector

**Created by:** Luiz Gabriel Magalh√£es Trindade

**License:** GPL-3.0

## Description

The RAM Memory Protector is a simple program designed to monitor RAM memory usage and protect the system from potential memory overflows. It continuously checks running processes and terminates those that exceed a predefined limit. Additionally, the program adapts its behavior based on the system's power profile, ensuring a more aggressive or conservative approach depending on whether the computer is using battery power or connected to the charger.

## Features

- **Continuous Monitoring:** The program performs regular checks of RAM memory usage to detect and respond to potential issues.

- **Dynamic Adjustment:** The program's behavior is adjusted based on the system's power profile, providing an adaptive response.

- **Process Termination:** Processes exceeding the defined percentage of memory usage are terminated to prevent overflows.
